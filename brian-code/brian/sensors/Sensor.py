        Waits until the sensor is ready. This function is blocking.

        When changing modes, the sensor enters a "not ready" state for a short period (until
        the mode change is propagated). Therefore, it is recommended to first set the correct
        mode using set_mode() before the calling this function. This only applies to sensors with modes.

        :param timeout_ms: Milliseconds to wait for readiness.
            - If None, there is no per-call wall-clock limit (wait until ready).
            - If 0 or negative, return immediately without waiting for readiness.
